# Jessica Chan - Building a Node.js app (as a JavaScript noob)

This is a solution to the [Jessica Chan's Building a Node.js app (as a JavaScript noob) project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYALykLb5oY). It's my first backend project, as I look to delve into the MERN stack. That is: MongoDB, Expressjs, Reactjs (which I already know), and Nodejs.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid (No)
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library (No)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework (No)
- Tailwind CSS (No)
- Typescript (No)
- Nodejs
- Expressjs

### What I learned

- First baptism putting Nodejs and Expressjs to use, and finally understanding essence of Server Side rendering (backend).
- Better understanding of use of Environmental variables, and essence of Server side rendering.
- Switching between node and powershell terminals in VsCode.
- Came back with better understanding roughly 5 weeks later and did a clean up, making sure to properly deploy.  

### Continued development

- More increasingly complex MERN stack projects.
